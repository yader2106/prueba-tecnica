This project is a basic crud in which we are modeling the periodic table. The basic steps to interact with the application are the following:


1) Install node dependencies
2) Once the dependencies are installed, the project can be run with ng serve --open
3) When you open the application you will get an empty table. if you want to add your own elements from 0 you can do it perfectly.

The app has a button at the end of the table which is called: generate list by default. This will generate a list with 10 example elements from the periodic table, which you can edit, delete, or keep adding more.

The app has a search field which searches by name.

For this app the basic tools were used:

Angular matter, Bootstrap, at the Angular level I deal with services, interfaces, Angular's own pipe and custom pipe.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
